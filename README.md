# Weather-Dashboard
A dynamic weather dashboard.
The motivation for this project is to access data from a server-side API. 
This project is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser 
and feature updated HTML and CSS.
The solution for this challenge is a 5 Day Weather Forecast link to an external site 
and retrieve weather data for varies cities.
I learned about API keys.
This project was collaborated with my tutors, Omaran Bazna and Juno Ngufen.
